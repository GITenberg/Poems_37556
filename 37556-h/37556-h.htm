<I>Song for an Unwritten Play.</I><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The moon's a drowsy fool to-night,<BR>
Wrapped in fleecy clouds and white;<BR>
And all the while Endymion<BR>
Sleeps on Latmos top alone.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not a single star is seen:<BR>
They are gathered round their queen,<BR>
Keeping vigil by her bed,<BR>
Patient and unwearièd.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now the poet drops his pen<BR>
And moves about like other men:<BR>
Tom o' Bedlam now is still<BR>
And sleeps beneath the hawthorn'd hill.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Only the Latmian shepherd deems<BR>
Something missing from his dreams<BR>
And tosses as he sleeps alone.<BR>
Alas, alas, Endymion!<BR>

<I>The Cup.</I><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
As a hot traveller<BR>
Going through stones and sands,<BR>
Who sees clear water stir<BR>
Amid the weary lands,<BR>
Takes in his hollowed hands<BR>
The clean and lively water,<BR>
That trickles down his throat<BR>
Like laughter, like laughter,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So when you come to me<BR>
Across these parchèd places<BR>
And all the waste I see<BR>
Flowered with your graces,<BR>
I take between my hands<BR>
Your face like a rare cup,<BR>
Where kisses mix with laughter,<BR>
And drink and drink them up<BR>
Like water, like water.<BR>

<I>A Rhymeless Song.</I><BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Rhyme with its jingle still betrays<BR>
The song that's meant for one alone.<BR>
Dearest, I dedicate to you<BR>
A little song without a rhyme.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The most unpractised schoolboy knows<BR>
That quiet kisses are the sweetest.<BR>
Safe locked within my arms you lie,<BR>
Let not a single sound betray us.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Suppose your jealous mother came<BR>
By chance this way and found us here...<BR>
Be still, be still, and not a sound<BR>
Shall give her warning that we love.<BR>

<I>Meadow and Orchard.</I><BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
My heart is like a meadow,<BR>
Where clouds go over,<BR>
Dappling the mingled grass and clover<BR>
With mingled sun and shadow,<BR>
With light that will not stay<BR>
And shade that sails away.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Your heart is like an orchard,<BR>
That has the sun for ever in its leaves,<BR>
Where, on the grass beneath the trees,<BR>
There falls the shadow of the fruit<BR>
That ripen there for me.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Who thinks that he possesses<BR>
His mistress with his kisses<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows neither love nor her.<BR>
Nor beauty is not his<BR>
Who seeks it in a kiss:<BR>
If you would seek for this<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O seek it otherwhere!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Love is a flame, a spirit<BR>
Beyond all earthly merit<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all we dream of here;<BR>
Strive as you may but still<BR>
Love is intangible,<BR>
No servant to your will<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sovereign otherwhere.<BR>

<I>Love in the Open Air.</I><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I'll love you in the open air<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stuffy rooms and blazing fires<BR>
And mirrors with familiar stare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloak and befoul my high desires.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The dearest day that I have known<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in the fields, when driving rain<BR>
Was like a veil around us thrown,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grey close veil without a stain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The young oak-tree was stripped and bare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But naked twigs a shelter made,<BR>
Where curious cows came round to stare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood astonished and dismayed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Let it be rain or summer sun,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell of wet earth or scent of flowers,<BR>
Love, once more give me, give me one<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these enchanted lover's hours.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
What hap, what chance can fall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sorrow come, what schism,<BR>
What loss, what cataclysm<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To part us two at all?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The stars with ageless fire<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In skies serene the same<BR>
Observe our young desire<BR>

A whisper soft, a sound<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfollowed, unattended,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sleep and it is ended.<BR>

You sleep and I alone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torment myself with fear<BR>
For new joys coming near<BR>

The wild duck fly over<BR>

And so the young lover<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes roving for ever.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
They fly together,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks alone:<BR>
No maiden can tether<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him with her moan.<BR>

At the bursting of blossom<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her breast his head;<BR>
He has left her bosom<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the apples are red.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Across the valley,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing he goes.<BR>
In highway and alley<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seeks a new rose.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now spring comes round again<BR>
With blossom on the tree,<BR>
Dark blossom of the peach,<BR>
Light blossom of the pear<BR>
And amorous birds complain<BR>
And nesting birds prepare<BR>
And love's keen fingers reach<BR>
After the heart of me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But now the blackthorn blows<BR>
About the dusty lane<BR>
And new buds peep and peer,<BR>
I have no joy at all,<BR>
For love draws near its close<BR>
And love's white blossoms fall<BR>
And in the springing year<BR>
Love's fingers bring me pain.<BR>

My mother told me this for true<BR>

That wear the mists about their feet<BR>

There grows the weed Forgetfulness,<BR>

If I but knew the way thereto,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days long would I wander<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times that kissed me.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The world's great ways unclose<BR>
Through little wooded hills:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An air that stirs and stills,<BR>
Dies sighing where it rose<BR>
Or flies to sigh again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In elms, whose stately rows<BR>
Receive the summer rain,<BR>
And clouds, clouds, clouds go by,<BR>
A drifting cavalry,<BR>
In squadrons that disperse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And troops that reassemble<BR>
And now they pass and now<BR>
Their glittering wealth disburse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tufted grass a-tremble<BR>
And lately leafing bough.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus through the shining day<BR>
We'll love or pass away<BR>
Light hours in golden sleep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clos'd half-sentient eyes<BR>
And lids the light comes through,<BR>
As sheep and flowers do<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who no new toils devise,<BR>
While shining insects creep<BR>
About us where we lie<BR>
Beneath a pleasant sky,<BR>
In fields no trouble fills,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence, as the traveller goes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's great ways unclose<BR>
Through little wooded hills.<BR>

Yet I feel in myself bright buds and blossoms,<BR>

Round it the men sit, washing their red hands.<BR>
Slowly the light grows, we call the roll over,<BR>
Bring the laggards stumbling from their warm cover,<BR>
Slowly the company gathers all together<BR>
And the men and the officer look shyly at the weather.<BR>

Into another day of most ignoble peace,<BR>
To drowse, to read, to smoke, to pray that war may cease.<BR>
The spring is coming on, and with the spring you go<BR>
In countries where strange scents on the April breezes blow;<BR>
You'll see the primroses marched down into the mud,<BR>
You'll see the hawthorn-tree wear crimson flowers of blood<BR>
And I shall walk about, as I did walk of old,<BR>
Where the laburnum trails its chains of useless gold,<BR>
I'll break a branch of may, I'll pick a violet<BR>
And see the new-born flowers that soldiers must forget,<BR>
I'll love, I'll laugh, I'll dream and write undying songs<BR>
But with your regiment my marching soul belongs.<BR>
Men that have marched with me and men that I have led<BR>
Shall know and feel the things that I have only read,<BR>
Shall know what thing it is to sleep beneath the skies<BR>
And to expect their death what time the sun shall rise.<BR>
Men that have marched with me shall march to peace again,<BR>
Bringing for plunder home glad memories of pain,<BR>
Of toils endured and done, of terrors quite brought under,<BR>
And all the world shall be their plaything and their wonder.<BR>
Then in that new-born world, unfriendly and estranged,<BR>
I shall be quite alone, I shall be left unchanged.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The husht September afternoon was sweet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rich and peaceful light.  I could not hear<BR>
On either side the sound of moving feet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the hidden road was very near.<BR>
The laden wood had powdered sun in it,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped through the leaves, a quiet messenger<BR>
To tell me of the golden world outside<BR>
Where fields of stubble stretched through counties wide.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And yet I did not move.  My head reposed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a tuft of dry and scented grass<BR>
And, with half-seeing eyes, through eyelids closed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched the languid chain of shadows pass,<BR>
Light as the slowly moving shade imposed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By summer clouds upon a sea of glass,<BR>
And strove to banish or to make more clear<BR>
The elusive and persistent dream of her.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then I saw her, very dim at first,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering for nuts amid the twisted boughs,<BR>
Thought her some warm-haired dryad, lately burst<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the chambers of her leafy house,<BR>
Seeking for nuts for food and for her thirst<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such water as the woodland stream allows,<BR>
After the greedy summer has drunk up<BR>
All but a drain within the mossy cup.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then I, beholding her, was still a space<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marked each posture as she moved or stood,<BR>
Watching the sunlight on her hair and face.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with calm folded hands and quiet blood<BR>
I gazed until her counterfeited grace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded and left me lonely in the wood,<BR>
Glad that the gods had given so much as this,<BR>
To see her, if I might not have her kiss.<BR>

This is the valley where we sojourn now,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut up by narrow brooks and rich and green<BR>
And shaded sweetly by the waving bough<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the trench where floats the soft serene<BR>
Arun with waters running low and low<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through banks where lately still the tide has been;<BR>
Here is our resting-place, you walk with me<BR>
And watch the light die out in Amberley.<BR>

The light that dies is soft and flooding still,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed from the broad expanse of all the skies<BR>
And brimming up the space from hill to hill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where yet the sheep in their sweet exercise,<BR>
Roaming the meadows, crop and find their fill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to each other speak with moaning cries;<BR>
We on the hill-side standing rest and see<BR>
The light die out in brook and grass and tree.<BR>

Lately we walked upon the lonely downs<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the still heat of the heavy day<BR>
We heard the medley of low drifting sounds<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the matted brambles found a way<BR>
Or lightly trod upon enchanted grounds<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musing, or with rich blackberries made delay,<BR>
Where feed such fruit on the rich air, until<BR>
We struck like falling stars from Bignor Hill.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Down the vast slope, by chalky roads and steep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With trees and bushes hidden here and there,<BR>
By circling turns into the valley deep<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came and left behind the hill-top air<BR>
For this cool village where to-night we sleep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country meal, a country bed to share,<BR>
With sleepy kisses and contented dreams<BR>
Over a land of still and narrow streams.<BR>

The light is ebbing in the dusky sky,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley floor is in the shadow.  Hark!<BR>
With rushing and mysterious noises fly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats already, looking for the dark<BR>
With blinking still and unaccustomed eye.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now over Rackham Mount a steady spark<BR>
Burns, rising slowly in the rising night,<BR>
And pledges peace and promises delight.<BR>

Now from the east the wheeling shade appears<BR>

Now in the dusk the village disappears,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's songs are hushed there and the children's calls,<BR>
While night in passage swallows up the land<BR>
And in the shadow your hand seeks my hand.<BR>

Only the glimmering stars in heaven lie<BR>

Float from the sleeping fields to please and die,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne up by roaming airs, that drift away<BR>
Beyond our hearing, vagabond and light,<BR>
To visit the cool meadows of the night.<BR>

Daphne is running, running through the grass,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long stalks whip her ankles as she goes.<BR>
I saw the nymph, the god, I saw them pass<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how a mounting flush of tender rose<BR>
Invaded the white bosom of the lass<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reached her shoulders, conquering their snows.<BR>
He wasted all his breath, imploring still:<BR>
They passed behind the shadow of the hill.<BR>

The mad course goes across the silent plain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flying footsteps make a path of sound<BR>
Through all the sleeping country.  Now with pain<BR>

That wounds her soft-palmed feet and now again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hastens through a wood where flowers abound,<BR>
Which staunch her cuts with balsam where she treads<BR>
And for her healing give their trodden heads.<BR>

Her sisters, from their coverts unbetrayed,<BR>

By them unhelped goes on the fleeting maid<BR>

Hard at her heels pursues the golden boy,<BR>
She flies in fear of him, she flies from joy.<BR>

His arrows scattered on the countryside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shining bow deserted, he pursues<BR>

But breathing deep and set and eager-eyed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flashing feet disperse the morning dews,<BR>
His hands most roughly put the boughs away,<BR>
That cross and cling and join and make delay.<BR>

Across small shining brooks and rills they leap<BR>

The silver minnows, wakened from their sleep<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sunny shallows, round her ankles gleam;<BR>
She scrambles up the grassy bank and on,<BR>
Though courage and quick breath are nearly done.<BR>

Now in the dusky spinneys round the field,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fauns set up a joyous mimicry,<BR>

And shout with joy to see her limbs revealed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give her grace and bid her swiftly flee:<BR>

Run, double, twist, evade, turn, grasp, elude.<BR>

Leads on the god and now she knows him nigh<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sees before her the unsheltered plain.<BR>
His hot hand touches her white side and she<BR>
Thrusts up her hands and turns into a tree.<BR>

The grey clouds flecked with orange are and gold,<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
